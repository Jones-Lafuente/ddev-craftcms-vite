# ddev-craftcms-vite 

Simple demo for [CraftCMS v5](https://craftcms.com/) + [DDEV](https://ddev.com/), including support for [nystudio107/craft-vite](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-vite). Have fun with it!

You can run this 1. on your local laptop or 2. on GitHub Codespaces (experimental).

## 1. Local setup (after clone)

The site will be available here after we're finished:

- https://ddev-craftcms-vite.ddev.site/

These are the first intial steps for a regular local setup:

```bash
cd ddev-craftcms-vite/
ddev start 

# install dependencies
ddev composer install && ddev npm install

# install craft cms
# You can remove password from this command if you want to enter it manually
ddev craft install/craft \
  --username="admin" \
  --email="admin@example.com" \
  --password="password123" \
  --site-name="Testsite" \
  --language="en" \
  --site-url='$DDEV_PRIMARY_URL'

# already installed in composer, but needs activation:
ddev craft plugin/install vite

# Open your website in browser, ...
ddev launch

# run local dev server (vite), ...
ddev npm run dev

# ... and hit reload in browser
```

## 2. Setup in Codespaces

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/mandrasch/ddev-craftcms-vite)

1. Click the button
1. Wait for `postCreateCommand.sh` to be finished
1. Switch vite port to public in ports tab
1. Run `ddev npm run dev`
1. Open site (web http) via ports tab (or use `ddev launch` in future (currently small bug to be fixed)).

See all steps in this video and blog post:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruw24tJHB5s
- https://dev.to/mandrasch/open-craftcms-in-github-codespaces-via-ddev-21he

The port switch can take a minute. Just wait if it doesn't work instantly.

Access control panel via `/admin` (or use in future `ddev launch /admin`, when small bug is fixed in ddev).

Login via user `admin` and password `newPassword` .

### Troubleshooting

See creation log via 'CMD + P > View creation log' if errors occur. Unfortunately there is no general error notification when this fails. But if there is only one port in the ports tab installation did not succeed.

Sometimes only a full rebuild solve the problems, use

- `SHIFT + CMD + P > Codespaces: Full rebuild` 

Containers and db will be deleted.

#### Could not connect to a docker provider

The error `Could not connect to a docker provider. Please start or install a docker provider.` occurs from 1 time out of 5, could not figure out why exactly yet. Please always make sure you're using `"ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-in-docker:2": {},`, not v1.

- Posted it here: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/63776

#### Disk space errors

Also `Your docker install has only 2163760 available disk space, less than 5000000 warning level (94% used). Please increase disk image size. ` errors occur from time to time as well.

### Technical background: workaround for vite port

Since the ddev router is not used on codespaces, the vite setup requires some adjustments. To access vite we expose another port (5174) via `.ddev/docker-compose.codespaces-vite.yaml`. This file is generated on codespace start up (and gitignored). 

We needed to adjust some config values in `config/vite.php` and `vite.config.js` as well when codespaces is used. If codespace is used, the new port 5174 needs to be used (instead of the port 5173 for local DDEV setups).

I implemented this via `.env`. 

See `.devcontainers/postCreateCommand.sh` for all steps.



## Simulate production environment

1. `ddev npm run build`
2. Switch `CRAFT_ENVIRONMENT=dev` to `CRAFT_ENVIRONMENT=production` in `.env`


## How was this created?

1. Followed the official [DDEV Quickstart for CraftCMS](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/quickstart/#craft-cms)

```bash
# https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/quickstart/#craft-cms
# Create a project directory and move into it:
mkdir my-craft-project
cd my-craft-project

# Set up the DDEV environment:
ddev config --project-type=craftcms --docroot=web --create-docroot

# Boot the project and install the starter project:
ddev start
ddev composer create -y --no-scripts craftcms/craft

# Run the Craft installer:
ddev craft install
ddev launch
```

2. Installed [nystudio107/craft-vite](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-vite):

```bash
# install via composer
ddev composer require nystudio107/craft-vite
# activate within craftcms
ddev craft plugin/install vite
```

3. Exposing the ports via [web_extra_exposed_ports](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/customization-extendibility/#exposing-extra-ports-via-ddev-router):

```yaml
web_extra_exposed_ports:
  - name: craft-vite
    container_port: 5173
    http_port: 5172
    https_port: 5173
```

‚ö†Ô∏è `ddev restart` is needed afterwards

4. Following https://nystudio107.com/docs/vite/#using-ddev and extend the previous config of `vite.config.js`:

```javascript
/* vite.config.js */
    // for ddev:
    server: {
        // respond to all network requests:
        host: '0.0.0.0',
        port: 5173,
        strictPort = true,
        // origin is important, see https://nystudio107.com/docs/vite/#vite-processed-assets
        origin: `${process.env.DDEV_PRIMARY_URL}:5173`
    },
```

5. Install npm deps, as stated here: https://nystudio107.com/blog/using-vite-js-next-generation-frontend-tooling-with-craft-cms

```bash
ddev npm init -y
ddev npm install -D vite vite-plugin-restart postcss autoprefixer @vitejs/plugin-legacy sass
```

Add the following scripts to `package.json`:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
```

- [ ] TODO: Is @vitejs/plugin-legacy always needed? (https://nystudio107.com/blog/using-vite-js-next-generation-frontend-tooling-with-craft-cms)

6. Edited `index.twig`, added craft-vite (and created `app.js` + `app.scss` file)

```
    {{ craft.vite.script("src/js/app.js", false) }} 
```

7. That's it, have fun!

8. Updated from v4 to v5 https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/upgrade.html
